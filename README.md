# cpp-2021-prog2
C++ code submitted as assignments for the 2021 Programming 2 course in FIng, UdelaR.
NOTE:
> TInfo data types are as follow: (nat, real). There exist various functions within "info.h" which help manipulate and work with this data type.

> There is a "main" program which ties all of the included subprograms together into one, however as it was completely written and given to students by the Programacion 2 Team at InCo from the FIng - UdelaR, rather than written by myself, I will not be sharing it. It does not add much to what is already done.
